## lab

Hi. This is a documentation site for what I would like to call as my lab. It takes heavy inspiration from [r/homelab](https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/) but it isn't exactly a home lab. It is a hybrid setup of the websites/applications I host on the cloud, the command line tools I make, and the services that I run at home.
